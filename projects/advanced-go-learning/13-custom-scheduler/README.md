# 13 - Custom Scheduler

**Status:** 🧪 Educational Project
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours

## Overview

Build a custom goroutine scheduler with work stealing, task prioritization, and dynamic worker management inspired by Go's runtime scheduler.

## Key Concepts

- Work stealing algorithm
- Run queues (local and global)
- Task prioritization
- Dynamic worker scaling
- CPU affinity simulation
- Cooperative scheduling

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Implement work stealing
- [ ] Create local/global queues
- [ ] Add task prioritization
- [ ] Dynamic worker management
- [ ] Comprehensive tests
- [ ] Benchmarks vs standard goroutines
