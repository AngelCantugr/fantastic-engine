# 15 - Lock-Free Data Structures

**Status:** 🧪 Educational Project
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours

## Overview

Implement lock-free data structures using atomic CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations: lock-free stack, queue, and counter.

## Key Concepts

- Compare-And-Swap (CAS) operations
- ABA problem and solutions
- Memory ordering
- Lock-free vs wait-free
- Performance characteristics
- Memory barriers

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Implement lock-free stack
- [ ] Implement lock-free queue
- [ ] Implement lock-free counter
- [ ] Handle ABA problem
- [ ] Comprehensive tests with race detector
- [ ] Benchmarks vs mutex-based
