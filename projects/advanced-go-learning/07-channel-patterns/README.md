# 07 - Channel Patterns

**Status:** 🧪 Educational Project
**Difficulty:** Intermediate-Advanced
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours

## Overview

Master advanced channel patterns in Go including pipelines, fan-out/fan-in, or-done, tee-channel, bridge, and more. Build production-ready concurrent systems.

## Key Concepts

- Pipeline pattern for data transformation
- Fan-out for parallel processing
- Fan-in for result aggregation
- Select for channel orchestration
- Buffered vs unbuffered channels
- Channel direction (send-only, receive-only)
- Graceful shutdown of goroutines

## Learning Objectives

1. Implement complex channel patterns
2. Build composable concurrent pipelines
3. Handle backpressure and cancellation
4. Prevent goroutine leaks
5. Design efficient concurrent systems
6. Test concurrent code effectively
