# 16 - Custom Garbage Collector

**Status:** 🧪 Educational Project
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

## Overview

Build a simplified garbage collector with mark-sweep algorithm, reference counting, and tri-color marking to understand Go's GC internals.

## Key Concepts

- Mark-sweep algorithm
- Tri-color marking
- Reference counting
