## Benefits of Hierarchy Syncing

### In TickTick
- **Subtasks appear nested** under their parent tasks
- **Progress tracking**: Parent shows completion % based on children
- **Collapsible**: Hide/show subtasks as needed
- **Mobile friendly**: Navigate parent → children easily

### In Obsidian
- **Maintains outline structure** for planning
- **Visual organization** with indentation
- **Easy to reorganize** by moving bullets
- **Context preserved** when jumping from TickTick link

### Sync Behavior
1. Parent task created first
2. Children linked to parent via `parentId`
3. Up to 3 levels of nesting (configurable)
4. All status changes sync both ways
5. Moving a task = creates new task (not yet supported)
