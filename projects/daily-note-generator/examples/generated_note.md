## 🌅 Where You Left Off

Yesterday was productive! You completed the API documentation and reviewed pull requests, which unblocked your teammates. You also found and fixed a critical auth bug before it reached production - great catch!

However, the database migration you wanted to start got blocked by the infrastructure team. They mentioned approval should come by Monday, so that's something to follow up on. You also discovered a performance issue in user queries that's now on your radar.

## 🎯 Priority Tasks (Focus on These!)

1. **Investigate performance issue in queries** - You discovered this yesterday; tackling it early prevents it from becoming a bigger problem. Plus, you're already familiar with the context from yesterday's debugging session.

2. **Follow up on database migration approval** - Check if the infrastructure team has approved it yet. If not, send a gentle reminder. If yes, you can start planning the migration for Monday.

3. **Call dentist for appointment** - Quick personal task that's been hanging around. Getting it done will clear mental space and feels great to check off!
