# Pomodoro Technique - Week 1

## Hypothesis

Using 25-minute Pomodoro sessions with 5-minute breaks will help maintain focus and reduce the number of rabbit holes I go down during coding work.

## Setup

- **Work Duration**: 25 minutes
- **Break Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Long Break**: 15 minutes (after 4 sessions)
- **Timer**: Toggl Track
- **Environment**: Home office, noise-canceling headphones
- **Distractions**: Phone in another room, Slack on "Do Not Disturb"

## Observations

### What Worked

- **Morning sessions (9-11am)** were most productive - energy was high and focus came easily
- **Blocking Slack** during Pomodoros reduced interruptions significantly
- **Background music** (lo-fi beats) helped maintain flow state
- **Physical breaks** - standing up and walking during breaks helped reset attention

### What Didn't Work

- **Wednesday afternoon slump** - energy crashed after lunch, hard to focus
- **25 minutes felt short** for deep coding tasks - just getting into flow when timer went off
- **Skipping breaks** on Thursday led to burnout by evening
- **Context switching** still happened during breaks - checked email/Slack

### Patterns Noticed

- Best focus: 9-11am daily
- Worst focus: 1-3pm (post-lunch)
- Thursday was best day overall - well-rested, clear goals
- Wednesday was worst - too many meetings in morning fragmented attention

## Learnings

1. **Pomodoros work, but need adjustment**: 25 minutes is good for admin tasks but too short for deep coding. Will try 45-minute sessions next week.

2. **Environment matters**: Noise-canceling headphones + lo-fi music is a winning combination for me.

3. **Energy patterns are real**: I'm clearly a morning person. Should protect 9-11am for deep work only.

4. **Breaks need structure**: "Break" time turned into distraction time. Need to be intentional about what I do during breaks.

5. **Context switching is the enemy**: Even small distractions (checking Slack during breaks) fragment focus.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Try 45-minute Pomodoro sessions for coding tasks
- [ ] Create structured break activities (stretch, water, walk - no devices)
- [ ] Block calendar from 9-11am daily for deep work
- [ ] Implement "focus mode" automation that blocks Slack, email, and notifications
- [ ] Track energy levels more granularly (hourly) to find optimal work windows
- [ ] Experiment with different background music to see what works best

## Weekly Summary

- **Total Sessions**: 32
- **Average Sessions/Day**: 6.4
- **Total Rabbit Holes**: 12
- **Average Rabbit Holes/Day**: 2.4
- **Task Completion Rate**: 81%
- **Average Energy**: 4.0/5
- **Average Joy**: 4.2/5
- **Total Deep Work**: 13.3 hours

**Overall**: Successful first week! The Pomodoro technique helped maintain focus and I completed more tasks than usual. Key insight: mornings are my superpower - need to protect that time fiercely.
