[00:00:00] Alice: Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our sprint planning session. Let's get started. Bob, can you give us a quick update on where we left off last sprint?

[00:00:45] Bob: Sure thing. Last sprint went pretty well overall. We closed 21 out of 23 story points. The two incomplete stories were the caching optimization, which turned out to be more complex than we thought, and the user notification feature, which got blocked waiting for the design team.

[00:01:30] Alice: Okay, thanks. Carol, have those design mockups been completed?

[00:01:37] Carol: Yes! I finished them yesterday. I'll share them in Slack right after this meeting. The new dashboard design is looking really good. I incorporated all the feedback from the last review.

[00:02:00] Alice: Perfect. So we can unblock that notification feature then. Let's talk about what we're planning for this sprint. I've been looking at the analytics integration project. I think this should be our main focus.

[00:02:30] Bob: I agree. The analytics integration has been on the roadmap for a while. From a technical perspective, I think we should use GraphQL instead of REST for this. It'll give us a lot more flexibility with the complex queries the product team wants.

[00:03:00] Alice: Interesting. Can you explain why GraphQL over REST?

[00:03:05] Bob: Sure. With GraphQL, the frontend can request exactly the data they need in a single query. This is especially important for the dashboard where we're showing data from multiple sources. With REST, we'd need multiple API calls and then combine the data on the frontend, which isn't ideal for performance.

[00:03:40] Carol: That makes sense from a design perspective too. The dashboard mockups have a lot of different data visualization components.

[00:03:50] David: From a QA perspective, I think GraphQL will actually make testing easier. We can test different query combinations more systematically.

[00:04:10] Alice: Alright, I'm convinced. Let's go with GraphQL for the analytics API. Bob, can you take the lead on setting up the GraphQL endpoint?

[00:04:20] Bob: Absolutely. I should have the basic structure done by Thursday, November 18th.

[00:04:30] Alice: Great. Carol, when can you have the dashboard mockups finalized?

[00:04:35] Carol: I'll have the complete set ready by Wednesday, November 17th. That includes all the edge cases and responsive layouts.

[00:04:50] Alice: Perfect. David, what about the test plan?

[00:04:55] David: I'll need to review the final specs first, but I can have a comprehensive test plan by Monday, November 20th. I'll include both unit tests and end-to-end scenarios.

[00:05:15] Alice: Sounds good. Now, let's talk about capacity. What's realistic for everyone this sprint?

[00:05:25] Bob: I can commit to 8 story points. I'll focus mainly on the GraphQL implementation and the analytics backend.

[00:05:35] Carol: I can do 6 points. That covers the dashboard implementation plus some minor design work on other features.

[00:05:45] David: I can take 5 points. Testing the analytics integration will be my main focus, but I also want to improve our test automation infrastructure.

[00:06:00] Alice: Okay, so that's 19 points total. I'll add 4 points as buffer for bug fixes and unexpected issues. That brings us to 23 points, same as last sprint.

[00:06:20] Bob: One thing I want to raise - we need to schedule an infrastructure review meeting. The analytics feature will put additional load on our database, and I want to make sure we're prepared for that.

[00:06:40] Alice: Good point. David, can you schedule that? Invite the ops team too.

[00:06:45] David: Will do. I'll set it up for early next week.

[00:07:00] Alice: Before we wrap up, let's talk about the release timeline. When can we realistically ship this analytics dashboard?

[00:07:10] Bob: Given the scope, I think we need at least two sprints. This sprint for core functionality, next sprint for polish and bug fixes.

[00:07:25] Carol: I agree. We should target December 1st for a beta release to internal users. That gives us time to gather feedback before the public launch.

[00:07:40] Alice: December 1st sounds reasonable. Let's make that our target. Any other concerns or blockers?

[00:07:55] David: Just one thing - we should implement end-to-end tests before we enable the feature flag. This is a critical user-facing feature, and we can't risk bugs in production.

[00:08:10] Alice: Absolutely agree. Let's make E2E testing a requirement before release. I'll add that to our definition of done.

[00:08:25] Bob: I think we're good then. This feels like a solid plan.

[00:08:30] Carol: Agreed. I'm excited to see this come together.

[00:08:35] Alice: Great! Let me summarize our action items. Bob, you're setting up the GraphQL endpoint by Thursday. Carol, dashboard mockups by Wednesday. David, test plan by next Monday and schedule the infrastructure meeting. Everyone clear on their responsibilities?

[00:08:55] Bob: Crystal clear.

[00:08:57] Carol: Yep, all set.

[00:09:00] David: Got it.

[00:09:02] Alice: Excellent. Thanks everyone for a productive session. Let's make this sprint count!

[00:09:10] All: Thanks! Bye!
