# Agent 8: Architecture Advisor ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Complexity:** Advanced | **Framework:** `crewai` | **Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- ✅ Multi-agent systems with CrewAI
- ✅ Role-based agents
- ✅ Agent collaboration
- ✅ Task delegation
- ✅ Consensus mechanisms

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### Multi-Agent Systems

Instead of one agent, multiple specialized agents work together:
- **Architect Agent**: Designs high-level architecture
- **Security Agent**: Reviews security aspects
- **Performance Agent**: Analyzes scalability
- **DevOps Agent**: Considers deployment

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Get architecture advice for a project
python agent.py --project "Build a real-time chat application"

# With specific constraints
python agent.py --project "E-commerce platform" --users 100000 --budget low
```
