## 🚀 Starting a New Experiment

### Quick Start

```bash
# Create experiment folder
mkdir experiments/my-experiment
cd experiments/my-experiment

# Create README
cat > README.md << 'EOF'
# My Experiment

**Status:** 🧪 Experimental
**Started:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Tech Stack:** [Your stack]

## Goal
[What you're exploring]

## Learning Log
[Document as you go]
EOF

# Add to mkdocs.yml
# Add entry under "Experiments:" in nav section
```

### Experiment Template

Use this structure:

```
experiments/my-experiment/
├── README.md           # Main documentation
├── [your files]        # Experiment code/configs
└── learnings.md        # Key takeaways
```

**Don't forget:** Add to `mkdocs.yml` nav section!

## 🎓 Experiment Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- **Document as you go** - Don't wait for "later"
- **Time-box** - Set a time limit for experiments
- **Clear goal** - Know what you're exploring
- **Small scope** - Start small, expand if promising
- **Fail fast** - If it's not working, document why and move on

### ❌ Avoid

- **Scope creep** - Stick to original goal
- **Perfection** - Done > Perfect for experiments
- **Multiple simultaneous** - Finish or pause one first
- **No documentation** - Always document learnings

---

## 📈 Graduation Path

Experiments graduate when they:

- ✅ Prove valuable over time
- ✅ Reach stable, reusable state
- ✅ Have comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Are ready for broader use
- ✅ Justify their own repository

**Graduation process:**
1. Complete graduation criteria
2. Create new repository
3. Move files (optionally preserve git history)
4. Mark as 📦 Graduated
5. Update this index with link
