## 💡 ADHD-Specific Tips

### Keep It Stupid Simple
If you're not doing the routine, it's too complex. Simplify.

### Visual Cues
- Post-it on monitor with prompt
- Desktop wallpaper with routine
- Phone wallpaper reminder

### Pair with Existing Habits
- Morning routine → after first coffee
- Evening routine → before closing laptop
- Weekly review → Friday shutdown ritual

### Forgiveness
Missed a day? That's fine. Just do today's routine.

### Variety
Routines feel stale? Change the prompt wording. Same action, fresh words.
