## 🎯 Prompt Best Practices with Context7

### ✅ Do This
```
✅ "Using Context7, fetch the latest React 18.3 documentation for..."
✅ "Check Context7 for the current Next.js 14 App Router patterns..."
✅ "Query Context7 for Tailwind CSS 4.0 breaking changes..."
✅ "Reference the most recent TypeScript 5.3 docs for..."
```

### ❌ Not This
```
❌ "How do I use React hooks?"
   (Too vague, doesn't leverage Context7)

❌ "Show me a React component"
   (No version specified, no Context7 mention)

❌ "What's the best way to fetch data?"
   (Doesn't specify library or ask for current docs)
```

### 🔑 Key Elements
1. **Explicitly mention Context7** - "Using Context7" or "Check Context7"
2. **Specify versions** - "React 18.3", "Next.js 14", "Tailwind 4.0"
3. **Request current docs** - "latest", "current", "most recent"
4. **Be specific** - Name the exact API, pattern, or feature you need
